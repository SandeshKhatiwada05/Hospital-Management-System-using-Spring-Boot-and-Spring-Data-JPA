 1. Dropping a table

    If you want to drop your Spring Boot-created table (Patient_Db):

    DROP TABLE IF EXISTS "Patient_Db";


    Important: Postgres is case-sensitive for quoted identifiers. Without quotes, Patient_Db becomes patient_db.

    This will completely remove the table and all its data.


 2. Basic PostgreSQL commands

    List databases

    \l


    Connect to a database

    \c database_name


    List tables in current database

    \dt


    Describe table structure

    \d table_name


    Select all rows

    SELECT * FROM table_name;


    Insert data

    INSERT INTO table_name (col1, col2, ...) VALUES (val1, val2, ...);


    Delete table

    DROP TABLE table_name;


    Clear screen (does not exist in psql)

    clear doesn’t work in psql, use your terminal’s Ctrl+L instead.

    List sequences

    \d


    Help in psql

    \?

 3. Notes on your Spring Boot entity

    Column name "patient's name" is a terrible idea — the apostrophe and spaces will cause issues in queries. Postgres will require quotes every time:

    INSERT INTO "Patient_Db" ("patient's name", dob, gender, email, phoneNumber, age) VALUES (...);


    Better: patient_name or name. Avoid spaces and special characters.

    phoneNumber is mapped to phoneNumber in Spring Boot but the DB might convert it to snake_case automatically (phone_number). Check generated table using \d "Patient_Db".
